## why is this here?
I had to create a github page with a barebones readme file for a statistics class. A basic level of markdown was needed to be used. We could of been more creative and made this page look nice, it is clear I havn't done this.
## Things this project contains:

* Memes
* rickroll
* HTML
* CSS
* <em>**BOLD ITALIAN TEXT**</em>
